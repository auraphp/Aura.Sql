# Aura.Sql

A PDO extension that provides lazy connections, array quoting, identifier quoting, query profiling, value binding, and convenience methods for common fetch styles. Because it extends PDO, existing code that uses PDO can use this without any changes to the existing code.

## Installation and Autoloading

This package is installable and PSR-4 autoloadable via Composer as
[aura/sql][].

Alternatively, [download a release][], or clone this repository, then map the
`Aura\Sql\` namespace to the package `src/` directory.

## Dependencies

This package requires PHP 5.6 or later; it has also been tested on PHP 7 and
HHVM. We recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of
principle.

Aura library packages may sometimes depend on external interfaces, but never on
external implementations. This allows compliance with community standards
without compromising flexibility. For specifics, please examine the package
[composer.json][] file.
